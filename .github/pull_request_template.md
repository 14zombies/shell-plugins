Here are a few guidelines for writing a good changelog:
- Keep your description to a single sentence if you can, and use proper capitalization and punctuation, including a final period.
- Don't use emoji in your description.
- Avoid starting your sentence with "improved" or "fixed", especially when using those change types. Instead, describe the improvement or say what you fixed.
- Avoid using terminology like "Users are shown" or "You can now" and instead focus on the thing that was changed.
